\usage{
emfx(
  object,
  type = c("simple", "group", "calendar", "event"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{etwfe} model object.}

\item{type}{Character. The desired type of post-estimation aggregation.}

\item{by_xvar}{Logical. Should the results account for heterogeneous
treatment effects? Only relevant if the preceding \code{etwfe} call included a
specified \code{xvar} argument, i.e. interacted categorical covariate. The
default behaviour (\code{"auto"}) is to automatically estimate heterogeneous
treatment effects for each level of \code{xvar} if these are detected as part
of the underlying \code{etwfe} model object. Users can override by setting to
either \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE.} See the "Heterogeneous treatment effects"
section below.}

\item{collapse}{Logical. Collapse the data by (period by cohort) groups
before calculating marginal effects? This trades off a loss in estimate
accuracy (typically around the 1st or 2nd significant decimal point) for a
substantial improvement in estimation time for large datasets. The default
behaviour (\code{"auto"}) is to automatically collapse if the original dataset
has more than 500,000 rows. Users can override by setting either \code{FALSE} or
\code{TRUE}. Note that collapsing by group is only valid if the preceding \code{etwfe}
call was run with \code{"ivar = NULL"} (the default). See the "Performance
tips" section below.}

\item{predict}{Character. The type (scale) of prediction used to compute the
marginal effects. If \code{"response"} (the default), then the output is at the
level of the response variable, i.e. it is the expected predictor
\eqn{E(Y|X)}. If \code{"link"}, the value returned is the linear predictor of
the fitted model, i.e. \eqn{X\cdot \beta}. The difference should only
matter for nonlinear models. (Note: This argument is typically called
\code{type} when use in \code{\link[stats]{predict}} or
\code{\link[marginaleffects]{slopes}}, but we rename it here to avoid a
clash with the top-level \code{type} argument above.)}

\item{post_only}{Logical. Drop pre-treatment ATTs? Only evaluated if (a)
\code{type = "event"} and (b) the original \code{etwfe} model object was estimated
using the default \code{"notyet"} treated control group. If conditions (a) and
(b) are met then the pre-treatment effects will be zero as a mechanical
result of ETWFE's estimation setup. The default behaviour (\code{TRUE}) is
thus to drop these nuisance rows from the dataset. The \code{post_only} argument
recognises that you may still want to keep them for presentation purposes
(e.g., plotting an event study). Nevertheless, be forewarned that enabling
that behaviour via \code{FALSE} is \emph{strictly} performative: the "zero" treatment
effects for any pre-treatment periods is purely an artefact of the
estimation setup.}

\item{lean}{Logical. Enforces a lean return object; namely a simple
data.frame of the main results, stripped of ancillary attributes. Defaults
to \code{TRUE}, in which case \code{options(marginaleffects_lean = TRUE)} is set
internally at the start of the \code{emfx} call, before being reverted upon
exit. Note that this will disable some advanced \code{marginaleffects}
post-processing features, but those are unlikely to be used in the \code{emfx}
context and means that we can dramatically reduce the size of the return
object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to
\code{\link[marginaleffects:slopes]{marginaleffects::slopes}}. For example, you can pass \code{vcov = FALSE} to dramatically speed up estimation times of the main marginal
effects (but at the cost of not getting any information about standard
errors; see Performance tips below). Another potentially useful
application is testing whether heterogeneous treatment effects (i.e., the
levels of any \code{xvar} covariate) are equal by invoking the \code{hypothesis}
argument, e.g. \code{hypothesis = "b1 = b2"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of aggregated treatment effects along the
dimension(s) of interested. Note that this data.frame will have been
overloaded with the \code{\link[marginaleffects]{slopes}} class, and so
will come with a special print method. But the underlying columns will
usually include:
\itemize{
\item \code{term}
\item \code{contrast}
\item \verb{<type>} (i.e., the name of your \code{type} string)
\item \code{estimate}
\item \code{std.error}
\item \code{statistic}
\item \code{p.value}
\item \code{s.value}
\item \code{conf.low}
\item \code{conf.high}
}
}
\description{
Companion function to \code{etwfe}, enabling the recovery of aggregate treatment
effects along different dimensions of interest (e.g, an event study of
dynamic average treatment effects). \code{emfx} is a light wrapper around the
\code{\link[marginaleffects]{slopes}} function from the \strong{marginaleffects}
package.

\section{Performance tips}{


Under most situations, \code{etwfe} should complete very quickly. For its part,
\code{emfx} is quite performant too and should take a few seconds or less for
datasets under 100k rows. However, \code{emfx}'s computation time does tend to
scale non-linearly with the size of the original data, as well as the
number of interactions from the underlying \code{etwfe} model. Without getting
too deep into the weeds, the numerical delta method used to recover the
ATEs of interest has to estimate two prediction models for \emph{each}
coefficient in the model and then compute their standard errors. So, it's
a potentially expensive operation that can push the computation time for
large datasets (> 1m rows) up to several minutes or longer.

Fortunately, there are two complementary strategies that you can use to
speed things up. The first is to turn off the most expensive part of the
whole procedure---standard error calculation---by calling \code{emfx(..., vcov = FALSE)}. Doing so should bring the estimation time back down to a few
seconds or less, even for datasets in excess of a million rows. While the
loss of standard errors might not be an acceptable trade-off for projects
where statistical inference is critical, the good news is this first
strategy can still be combined our second strategy. It turns out that
collapsing the data by groups prior to estimating the marginal effects can
yield substantial speed gains of its own. Users can do this by invoking
the \code{emfx(..., collapse = TRUE)} argument. While the effect here is not as
dramatic as the first strategy, our second strategy does have the virtue
of retaining information about the standard errors. The trade-off this
time, however, is that collapsing our data does lead to a loss in accuracy
for our estimated parameters. On the other hand, testing suggests that
this loss in accuracy tends to be relatively minor, with results
equivalent up to the 1st or 2nd significant decimal place (or even
better).

Summarizing, here's a quick plan of attack for you to try if you are
worried about the estimation time for large datasets and models:
\enumerate{
\item Estimate \code{mod = etwfe(...)} as per usual.
\item Run \code{emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, ...)}.
\item Run \code{emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, collapse = TRUE, ...)}.
\item Compare the point estimates from steps 1 and 2. If they are are similar
enough to your satisfaction, get the approximate standard errors by
running \code{emfx(mod, collapse = TRUE, ...)}.
}

\section{Heterogeneous treatment effects}{


Specifying \verb{etwfe(..., xvar = <xvar>)} will generate interaction effects
for all levels of \verb{<xvar>} as part of the main regression model. The
reason that this is useful (as opposed to a regular, non-interacted
covariate in the formula RHS) is that it allows us to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects as part of the larger ETWFE framework.
Specifically, we can recover heterogeneous treatment effects for each
level of \verb{<xvar>} by passing the resulting \code{etwfe} model object on to
\code{emfx()}.

For example, imagine that we have a categorical variable called "age" in
our dataset, with two distinct levels "adult" and "child". Running
\code{emfx(etwfe(..., xvar = age))} will tell us how the efficacy of treatment
varies across adults and children. We can then also leverage the in-built
hypothesis testing infrastructure of \code{marginaleffects} to test whether
the treatment effect is statistically different across these two age
groups; see Examples below. Note the same principles carry over to
categorical variables with multiple levels, or even continuous variables
(although continuous variables are not as well supported yet).

# Basic example
#

# The basic ETWFE workflow involves two consecutive function calls:
# 1) `etwfe` and 2) `emfx`

# 1) `etwfe`: Estimate a regression model with saturated interaction terms.

mod = etwfe(
    fml  = lemp ~ lpop, # outcome ~ controls (use 0 or 1 if none)
    tvar = year,        # time variable
    gvar = first.treat, # group variable
    data = mpdta,       # dataset
    vcov = ~countyreal  # vcov adjustment (here: clustered by county)
    )

# mod ## A fixest model object with fully saturated interaction effects.

# 2) `emfx`: Recover the treatment effects of interest.

emfx(mod, type = "event") # dynamic ATE a la an event study

# Etc. Other aggregation type options are "simple" (the default), "group"
# and "calendar"

# Heterogeneous treatment effects
#

# Example where we estimate heterogeneous treatment effects for counties 
# within the 8 US Great Lake states (versus all other counties). 

gls = c("IL" = 17, "IN" = 18, "MI" = 26, "MN" = 27,
        "NY" = 36, "OH" = 39, "PA" = 42, "WI" = 55)

   xvar = gls           ## <= het. TEs by gls
   )

# Heterogeneous ATEs (could also specify "event", etc.) 

emfx(hmod)

# To test whether the ATEs across these two groups (non-GLS vs GLS) are 
# statistically different, simply pass an appropriate "hypothesis" argument.

emfx(hmod, hypothesis = "b1 = b2")
