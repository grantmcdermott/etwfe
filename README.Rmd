The goal of **etwfe** is to estimate extended two-way fixed effects _a la_
Wooldridge ([2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3906345),
[2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/ectj/utad016)).  Briefly,
Wooldridge proposes a set of saturated interaction effects to overcome the
potential bias problems of vanilla TWFE in difference-in-differences designs.
The Wooldridge solution is intuitive and elegant, but rather tedious and error
prone to code up manually. The **etwfe** package aims to simplify the process by
providing convenience functions that do the work for you.

Documentation is available on the package [homepage](https://grantmcdermott.com/etwfe/).

## Installation

You can install **etwfe** from CRAN.

```r
install.packages("etwfe")
```

Or, you can grab the development version from R-universe.

``` r
install.packages("etwfe", repos = "https://grantmcdermott.r-universe.dev")
```

## Quickstart example

A detailed walkthrough of **etwfe** is provided in the introductory vignette 
(available [online](https://grantmcdermott.com/etwfe/articles/etwfe.html), or
by typing `vignette("etwfe")` in your R console). But here's a quickstart
example to demonstrate the basic syntax.

Start by loading the package and some data.

```{r mpdta}
library(etwfe)

# install.packages("did")
data("mpdta", package = "did")
head(mpdta, 2)
```

**Step 1:** Run `etwfe()` to estimate a model with full saturated interactions.
```{r etwfe}
mod = etwfe(
  fml  = lemp ~ lpop, # outcome ~ controls
  tvar = year,        # time variable
  gvar = first.treat, # group variable
  data = mpdta,       # dataset
  vcov = ~countyreal  # vcov adjustment (here: clustered)
)
mod
```

**Step 2:** Pass to `emfx()` to recover the ATTs of interest. In this case, an
event-study example.
```{r emfx}
emfx(mod, type = "event")
```
