Among things, core interaction term standard TWFE can provide biased estimate true treatment effect rollout treatment staggered time (common occurrence). Fortunately, just econometricians taking away one favourite tools, kind enough replace new ones. Among , proposed approach Wooldridge (2021) noteworthy. idea might paraphrased stating problem TWFE first place. Rather, ’s weren’t enough. Instead including single treatment × time interaction, Wooldridge recommends saturate model possible interactions treatment time variables, including treatment cohorts, well covariates. goes show approach actually draws equivalence different types estimators (pooled OLS, twoway Mundlak regression, etc.) ’s entirely clear call .

However, raw coefficients etwfe() estimation particularly meaningful . Remember complex multiway interaction terms probably hard interpret . , probably want aggregate along dimension interest instead (e.g., groups time, event study). natural way perform aggregations recovering appropriate marginal effects. etwfe package provides another convenience function : emfx(), thin(ish) wrapper around marginaleffects::marginaleffects(). example, can recover average treatment effect follows. , can recover dynamic treatment effects la event study invoking type argument. time ’ll save resulting object since plan reuse moment. (types aggregations include \"calendar\" (: treatment year effects) \"group\" (: treatment cohort).) Since emfx produces standard marginaleffects object, can pass supported methods packages. example, can get get pass modelsummary get nice regression table event study coefficients.
