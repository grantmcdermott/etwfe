#' Extended two-way fixed effects

#' @md
#' @description
#' Estimates an "extended" two-way fixed effects regression, with fully
#' saturated interaction effects _a la_ Wooldridge (2021, 2023). At its heart,
#' `etwfe` is a convenience function that automates a number of tedious and
#' error prone preparation steps involving both the data and model formulae.
#' Computation is passed on to the \code{\link[fixest]{feols}} (linear) /
#' \code{\link[fixest]{feglm}} (nonlinear) functions from the **fixest**
#' package. `etwfe` should be paired with its companion [`emfx`] function.
#'
#' @param fml A two-side formula representing the outcome (lhs) and any control
#'   variables (rhs), e.g. `y ~ x1 + x2`. If no controls are required, the rhs
#'   must take the value of 0 or 1, e.g. `y ~ 0`.
#' @param tvar Time variable. Can be a string (e.g., "year") or an expression
#'   (e.g., year).
#' @param gvar Group variable. Can be either a string (e.g., "first_treated")
#'   or an expression (e.g., first_treated). In a staggered treatment setting,
#'   the group variable typically denotes treatment cohort.
#' @param data The data frame that you want to run ETWFE on.
#' @param ivar Optional index variable. Can be a string (e.g., "country") or an
#'   expression (e.g., country). Leaving as NULL (the default) will result in
#'   group-level fixed effects being used, which is more efficient and
#'   necessary for nonlinear models (see `family` argument below). However, you
#'   may still want to cluster your standard errors by your index variable
#'   through the `vcov` argument. See Examples below.
#' @param xvar Optional interacted categorical covariate for estimating
#'   heterogeneous treatment effects. Enables recovery of the marginal
#'   treatment effect for distinct levels of `xvar`, e.g. "child", "teenager",
#'   or "adult". Note that the "x" prefix in "xvar" represents a covariate that
#'   is *interacted* with treatment, as opposed to a regular control variable.
#' @param tref Optional reference value for `tvar`. Defaults to its minimum
#'   value (i.e., the first time period observed in the dataset).
#' @param gref Optional reference value for `gvar`. You shouldn't need to
#'   provide this if your `gvar` variable is well specified. But providing an
#'   explicit reference value can be useful/necessary if the desired control
#'   group takes an unusual value.
#' @param cgroup What control group do you wish to use for estimating treatment
#'   effects. Either "notyet" treated (the default) or "never" treated.
#' @param fe What category of fixed effects should be used? One of either `"vs"`
#'   (varying slopes), `"feo"` (fixed effects only), or `"none"` (no fixed
#'   effects whatsoever). If left as `NULL` (i.e., no explicit choice) then
#'   will default to `"vs"` for linear/Gaussian models, since this is the most
#'   efficient estimation option and further limits the number of "nuisance"
#'   parameters in the return model object. However, for non-Gaussian families
#'   will default to `"none"`, since the downstream [`emfx`] function cannot
#'   compute standard errors for these models in the presence of fixed-effects.
#'   (See: https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues/1487)
#'   Please note that the primary treatment parameters of interest should
#'   remain unchanged regardless of `fe` argument choice.
#' @param family Which [`family`] to use for the estimation. Defaults to NULL,
#'   in which case [`fixest::feols`] is used. Otherwise passed to
#'   [`fixest::feglm`], so that valid entries include "logit", "poisson", and
#'   "negbin". Note that if a non-NULL family entry is detected, `ivar` will
#'   automatically be set to NULL.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to [`fixest::feols`] (or
#'   [`fixest::feglm`]). The most common example would be a `vcov` argument.
#' @return A \code{\link[fixest]{fixest}} object with fully saturated
#' interaction effects, and a few additional attributes used for
#' post-estimation in `emfx`.

#'
#' @section Heterogeneous treatment effects:
#'
#'   Specifying `etwfe(..., xvar = <xvar>)` will generate interaction effects
#'   for all levels of `<xvar>` as part of the main regression model. The
#'   reason that this is useful (as opposed to a regular, non-interacted
#'   covariate in the formula RHS) is that it allows us to estimate
#'   heterogeneous treatment effects as part of the larger ETWFE framework.
#'   Specifically, we can recover heterogeneous treatment effects for each
#'   level of `<xvar>` by passing the resulting `etwfe` model object on to
#'   `emfx()`.
#'
#'   For example, imagine that we have a categorical variable called "age" in
#'   our dataset, with two distinct levels "adult" and "child". Running
#'   `emfx(etwfe(..., xvar = age))` will tell us how the efficacy of treatment
#'   varies across adults and children. We can then also leverage the in-built
#'   hypothesis testing infrastructure of `marginaleffects` to test whether
#'   the treatment effect is statistically different across these two age
#'   groups; see Examples below. Note the same principles carry over to
#'   categorical variables with multiple levels, or even continuous variables
#'   (although continuous variables are not as well supported yet).
#'
#' @section Performance tips:
#'
#'   Under most situations, `etwfe` should complete very quickly. For its part,
#'   `emfx` is quite performant too and should take a few seconds or less for
#'   datasets under 100k rows. However, `emfx`'s computation time does tend to
#'   scale non-linearly with the size of the original data, as well as the
#'   number of interactions from the underlying `etwfe` model. Without getting
#'   too deep into the weeds, the numerical delta method used to recover the
#'   ATEs of interest has to estimate two prediction models for *each*
#'   coefficient in the model and then compute their standard errors. So, it's
#'   a potentially expensive operation that can push the computation time for
#'   large datasets (> 1m rows) up to several minutes or longer.
#'
#'   Fortunately, there are two complementary strategies that you can use to
#'   speed things up. The first is to turn off the most expensive part of the
#'   whole procedure---standard error calculation---by calling `emfx(..., vcov
#'   = FALSE)`. Doing so should bring the estimation time back down to a few
#'   seconds or less, even for datasets in excess of a million rows. While the
#'   loss of standard errors might not be an acceptable trade-off for projects
#'   where statistical inference is critical, the good news is this first
#'   strategy can still be combined our second strategy. It turns out that
#'   collapsing the data by groups prior to estimating the marginal effects can
#'   yield substantial speed gains of its own. Users can do this by invoking
#'   the `emfx(..., collapse = TRUE)` argument. While the effect here is not as
#'   dramatic as the first strategy, our second strategy does have the virtue
#'   of retaining information about the standard errors. The trade-off this
#'   time, however, is that collapsing our data does lead to a loss in accuracy
#'   for our estimated parameters. On the other hand, testing suggests that
#'   this loss in accuracy tends to be relatively minor, with results
#'   equivalent up to the 1st or 2nd significant decimal place (or even
#'   better).
#'
#'   Summarizing, here's a quick plan of attack for you to try if you are
#'   worried about the estimation time for large datasets and models:
#'
#'   0. Estimate `mod = etwfe(...)` as per usual.
#'
#'   1. Run `emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, ...)`.
#'
#'   2. Run `emfx(mod, vcov = FALSE, collapse = TRUE, ...)`.
#'
#'   3. Compare the point estimates from steps 1 and 2. If they are are similar
#'   enough to your satisfaction, get the approximate standard errors by
#'   running `emfx(mod, collapse = TRUE, ...)`.
